# TODO

Post a notice if the MQTT broker disconnects.

Is it possible to have the MQTT plugin send data from only one `$source`? This
would allow multiple devices to provide duplicate data.

Default should be to move the map to follow the boat. If the user moves the map,
it stays put. A button restores default behavior.

Track for the position over the last hour.

Boat icon with the shape of the Flyer.

Allow the boat icon, COG line and wind line to all share the same
`AdvancedMarkerElement`.
