# TODO

## Table related issues

- Predetermine table ordering
- Need a higher-level context that holds the vessel's position, so it can be used by both the map and the table.
- eslint says: "useEffect has missing dependencies: 'formattedState' and 'vesselState'. Either include them or remove
  the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'client' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't
  re-render the component"

Post a notice if the MQTT broker disconnects.
