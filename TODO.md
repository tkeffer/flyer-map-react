# TODO

Post a notice if the MQTT broker disconnects.

Is it possible to have the MQTT plugin send data from only one `$source`? This
would allow multiple devices to provide duplicate data.

Default should be to move the map to follow the boat. If the user moves the map,
it stays put. A button restores default behavior.

Figure out how to show depth. It does not appear to be in the NMEA 2000 feed 
that the PRO-NDC sees. Perhaps it's on a different network segment?
