# TODO

Post a notice if the MQTT broker disconnects.

Is it possible to have the MQTT plugin send data from only one `$source`? This
would allow multiple devices to provide duplicate data.

Default should be to move the map to follow the boat. If the user moves the map,
it stays put. A button restores default behavior.

Add an explanation of what the white and black lines mean.

Include a pop-up for the wind bar.
