# TODO

Post a notice if the MQTT broker disconnects.

Is it possible to have the MQTT plugin send data from only one `$source`? This
would allow multiple devices to provide duplicate data.

Default should be to move the map to follow the boat. If the user moves the map,
it stays put. A button restores default behavior.

The COG line and the wind barb don't quite meet. It looks like the COG line is
slightly off. Something about the translation?

Include pop-ups for the wind and COG vectors.

Explanation of what the black and purple lines mean.
